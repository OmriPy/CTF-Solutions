# Exploit
```
./random
3039230856
```

## Explanation
The function `rand` returns a random value. But, whenever you execute the executable file the `rand` function is in, it will return the same random value.
With a little sneaking into gdb, we can see that the "random" value is `0x6b8b4567`.
```c
if( (key ^ random) == 0xdeadbeef ){
	printf("Good!\n");
	system("/bin/cat flag");
	return 0;
}
```
If `xor input, 0x6b8b4567` equals `0xdeadbeef`, we will get the flag.
We don't need to check every number between 0 and 2^32, we can just do a reversed xor. It will look like that: `xor 0xdeadbeef, 0x6b8b4567 == input`.

Now, we just need to know what is the value of `xor 0xdeadbeef, 0x6b8b4567`, and we got the correct input.
The value is `0xb526fb88`, in decimal it is `3039230856`.

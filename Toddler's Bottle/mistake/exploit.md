The exploit:

./mistake
FFFFFFFFFF
input password : GGGGGGGGGG

Explanation:
The code xors our input by 1 (xor input, 1).
So I checked what is the result of (F = 0x46) xor 0x46, 1. And the result was 0x47 which is G.
Also, we know that the code only takes 10 bytes and each ascii character is 1 byte so I entered 10 times F and 10 times G.
In conclusion, becuase xor 0x46, 1 = 0x47 (xor F, 1 = G), the strncmp function returned 0 which means the strings are equal.

But why in the first place did the executable ask for input twice? scanf appears in the code once.
`scanf`
